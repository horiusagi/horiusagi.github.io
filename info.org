while in the repository ~/Documents/_website/horiusagi/ do..

$bundle exec jekyll serve      ;<-to start the jekyll server. 
navigate to 127.0.0.1:4000 in chrome to launch the test site.

$git add .                     ;<-stages the changes to the repository
$git commit -m "<useful note>" ;<-makes a snapshot of the current state
$git push -u origin master     ;<-pushes the current state to github


since Jekyll is in active development and is updated frequently, as the GitHub Pages server is updated, the software on your computer may become out of date, resulting in your site appearing different locally from how it looks when published to github.
so...
run this update command:
$bundle update github-pages
or simply:
$bundle update




*************************
basics of git:
when you start a project in your directory you should initalize git to manage the difs as you make changes in your files so that you have snapshots of any changes you make along the way. 
you create this by typing:
$git init
this creates a directory called ".git" in the project's root directory.

to check the status of the git repository type:
$git status
